# Vending Machine

Users have the ability to select a button that represents a beverage of choice in a vending machine. Each Item that is selected will decrease the inventory of that item by one and add $1 per drink. All of this is visible in the back end where the user can add a new item, or update the quantity of drinks as well as check on the money earned.
